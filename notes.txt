Express Basics Notes:

A server is a program that runs on a remote computer 
Its job is to wait for http requests 

Express handles requests through routes that we can set up in the app

From a users perspective, a route is just like a URL

Its called a route because its the path a user takes to access data 
on a server

From the applications persepctive, a route is a command to run a specific function
which, in turn, send a response back to a client
